# Task 2: Data Cleaning and EDA on Titanic Dataset

## About this task
For this task, I explored and cleaned the Titanic dataset to see what patterns I could find.  
I used **Jupyter Notebook**, which was new for me, and it actually made the work feel easier to follow step by step.

## What I did
- Loaded the dataset into *pandas* and checked its structure
- Found and handled missing values in **Age** and **Embarked**
- Dropped the **Cabin** column because it had too many missing values
- Made simple visualizations to see survival by gender and passenger class
- Plotted age and fare distributions to understand how data is spread

## What I learned
- *How to clean real-world data* using pandas
- *How to make quick, clear plots* with seaborn and matplotlib
- Writing small explanations in Jupyter Notebook helps to see what I’m doing and why
- It felt different from just writing code in VS Code — more like telling a story with data

## Steps I followed
1. Import libraries and load the dataset
2. Explore data to see columns and missing values
3. Fill or drop missing values where needed
4. Create visualizations to check survival patterns
5. Write short notes about what each plot shows

## Files included
- **Titanic.ipynb** – Jupyter Notebook with my code, plots, and notes
- **README.md** – this file, explaining what I did in simple words

## Final thoughts
It was interesting to see how data cleaning and EDA can help understand real data.  
Learning to do this inside Jupyter Notebook made the process clearer and a bit more fun.
